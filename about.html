        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Founded in 2018, Benta B Beauty was born from a passion to showcase the incredible natural ingredients found in Kenya. Our journey began when our founders discovered the transformative power of local botanicals and decided to share these treasures with the world.</p>
                    <p>We source our ingredients ethically from local farmers and communities across Kenya, ensuring fair trade practices and supporting sustainable agriculture. Each product is carefully crafted to harness the full potential of these powerful natural ingredients.</p>
                    <p>At Benta B Beauty, we believe in beauty that celebrates your natural features while nourishing your skin. Our formulations are free from harmful chemicals, parabens, and artificial fragrances, making them suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin.</p>
                    <p>We're proud to be 100% Kenyan-owned and operated, contributing to the local economy and showcasing African beauty traditions to the world.</p>
